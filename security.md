# Security

If you've found a security issue in any Charcoal project, please don't post it publicly
(including in Charcoal HQ, our chatroom). Instead, email details of the vulnerability to 
[security@charcoal-se.org](mailto:security@charcoal-se.org), which is a mailing list that will reach the necessary people.
They'll have a look and confirm whether or not it's a security issue, and deal with it appropriately.

If you'd like to encrypt your email, you can find our PGP key here: <https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/security-pubkey.txt>
