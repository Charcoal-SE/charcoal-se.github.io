This wiki page contains a list of commands and their explanation.

## Commands for everyone

These commands can be executed by everyone.

- `!!/alive` — Replies a random message taken from a list so you can see that SmokeDetector is still running.
- `!!/status` — Shows the UTC date when SmokeDetector started running.
- `!!/rev` or `!!/ver` — Shows the running Git revision.

- `!!/apiquota` — Shows the remaining API quota of SmokeDetector.
- `!!/queuestatus` — Shows the queue status of BodyFetcher.
- `!!/blame` — Chooses randomly from a list of people who have talked recently in the room.
- `!!/lick`, `!!/wut`, `!!/coffee`, `!!/tea`, and `!!/brownie` — better versions of `!!/alive`, aka 'fun' commands.
- `!!/location` — Replies with the current location, as set in the `config` file.
- `!!/test <string>` — Runs `<string>` against the filter as if it appeared in a question title, body, or username. To test specifically, use `!!/test-a` for answer, `!!/test-q` for question body, `!!/test-t` for title, or `!!/test-u` for username.
- `!!/isblu`, `!!/iswlu` — Checks if a user is blacklisted/whitelisted. Two formats are accepted: `<profile_URL>` or `<user_ID> <site_name>`
- `!!/whoami` — Replies with the bot's user id for that site
- `!!/amiprivileged` — Lets you know if you are in the list of privileged users
- `!!/amicodeprivileged` — Lets you know whether or not you have code privileges (i.e. you can blacklist without approval)
- `!!/notify <chatroom_ID_number> <site_domain>` — Tells SmokeDetector to ping you, in the given chatroom, when a post is reported on the given site.  
  Example:  `!!/notify 89 parenting.stackexchange.com-`  
  Note: Please use the squelch suffix (`-`) and avoid spamming the chat room with too many requests. See [this chat message](http://chat.meta.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/4157790#4157790) and the surrounding context.
- `!!/unnotify <chatroom_ID_number> <site_domain>` — Cancels the previously set notification.  Also, accepts the silent mode suffix&nbsp;(`-`).
- `!!/willibenotified <chatroom_ID_number> <site_domain>` — Reports whether you will be pinged, in the given room, about spam on the given site.
- `!!/allnotificationsites <chatroom_ID_number>` — Shows all sites that you will be pinged for in the given room.

## Commands as reply for everyone

- `why` — Shows the reason that SmokeDetector caught a post.  
  Note that `why` data is only kept for the last 50 reports. If you need to see older data, it can be found in the post record on Metasmoke.
- `autoflagged` — Returns if the post was autoflagged or not, and if so, what users were used.

## Privileged commands

These commands require privileges.
<!-- These were not in any order. Recommend most-used/useful up top. -->

- `!!/report <post URL 1> [<post URL 2> [...]]` — Makes SmokeDetector report a specific post/multiple specific posts in Charcoal HQ and Tavern on the Meta. The originator of each post will be added to the blacklist. Maximally 5 at a time. Additionally, the post will be added to the database on Metasmoke, just like all other posts.
- `!!/allspam <user URL>` — To be used if a spammer has many posts so you don't have to use `!!/report`. This command posts a message about the user in all applicable rooms.  Note that this command does NOT auto-TPU anything, for various reasons. It has an alias, `!!/reportuser <user URL>`
- `!!/blacklist <regex>` — **This command is deprecated.** Use one of the three specialized blacklist commands instead, which are shown below. If run, this command will print a help
- `!!/blacklist-website <regex>` — Adds a regular expression pattern to the [website blacklist](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/blob/master/blacklisted_websites.txt). Make sure regex special characters are escaped (in particular `.` characters should be escaped as `\.`). If you are a code admin on metasmoke, your change will apply immediately once CI passes; otherwise, a pull request will be created for your changes so that they can be reviewed.
- `!!/blacklist-keyword <regex>` — Adds a regular expression pattern to the [list of bad keywords](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/blob/master/bad_keywords.txt). Just like `!!/blacklist-website`, if you are a code admin on metasmoke your change will apply immediately once CI passes; otherwise, a pull request will be created for your changes to that they can be reviewed.
- `!!/blacklist-username <regex>` — Adds a regular expression pattern to the [username blacklist](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/blob/master/blacklisted_usernames.txt). Just like `!!/blacklist-website` and `!!/blacklist-keyword`, if you are a code admin on metasmoke your change will apply immediately once CI passes; otherwise, a pull request will be created for your changes to that they can be reviewed.
- `!!/watch-keyword <regex>` - Adds a regular expression pattern to a "watch list" which is similar to the list of bad keywords (see `!!/blacklist-keyword` above) but with less strict criteria for what you can list.  The intent is that you can set up Smoke Detector to watch for something and be alerted when it actually happens.  Typical phrases to watch include domain names and phrases which have not occurred before but not enough to actually blacklist (yet).
- `!!/addwlu <profile_URL>` or `!!/addwlu <user_ID> <site_name>` — Adds a user to the whitelist (this means that if the username for that user matches one of the regexes, this will be ignored).
- `!!/rmwlu <profile_URL>` or `!!/rmwlu <user_ID> <site_name>` — Removes a user from the whitelist.
- `!!/addblu` (same syntax as `!!/addwlu`) — Adds a user to the blacklist (this means that any post of this user will be reported).
- `!!/rmblu` (same syntax as `!!/rmwlu`) — Removes a user from the blacklist.
- `!!/reboot` — Reboots SmokeDetector.
- `!!/stappit` — Stops all SmokeDetector instances.
- `!!/stappit <string>` — Stops all SmokeDetector instances where `string` is included in the location (e.g. `!!/stappit undo` would stop `Undo/EC2` and `Undo/DO`, but not `teward/aroura`
- `!!/pull` — Pulls new revisions from GitHub.
- `!!/master` — When SmokeDetector enters reverted mode, use this command to go back to the `master` branch.
- `!!/errorlogs <N>` — Shows the last *N* lines of the error logs.
- `!!/block <N>` — Blocks SmokeDetector globally for *N* seconds; no alerts will be posted. Example: `!!/block 600` blocks globally for 10 minutes.
- `!!/block <N> <room_id>` — Blocks SmokeDetector in the specific room for *N* seconds; no alerts will be posted there. Example: `!!/block 3600 89` blocks alerts in the Tavern for one hour.
- `!!/unblock` — Unblock SmokeDetector manually, resetting global block only.
- `!!/unblock <room_id>` — Unblock SmokeDetector manually in the specific room.


## Privileged commands as reply

These commands require privileges and have to be posted as a reply to a message of SmokeDetector.

User-friendly syntax:

- use `spam` or `rude` or `abusive` or `offensive` for posts that should be flagged as such (equivalent to `tpu-`; see below)
- use `v`, `vand` or `vandalism` for posts that have been vandalised and the vandalism edit should be rolled back (equivalent to `tp-`)
- use `notspam` if the post should not be flagged (equivalent to `fp-`)

Complete list:

- `tp` or `true` — Marks a reported post as true positive.
- `tpu` or `trueu` — Marks a reported post as true positive and adds the poster to the blacklist.
- `fp` or `false` — Marks a reported post as false positive. Additionally removes the user from the blacklist, if that was the reason that the post was reported.
- `fpu` or `falseu` — Marks a reported post as false positive and adds the poster to the whitelist.
- `naa` — If the reported post is an answer, this command records it as NAA (Not an answer) in metasmoke.
- `ignore` — Makes SmokeDetector ignore a reported post.
- `delete`, `del`, `remove` or `gone` — Deletes a message of SmokeDetector. This has been disabled in CHQ due to the reasons [listed below](#a-note-on-message-deletion). But if you really need to delete a message, use `sd delete-force`.
- `postgone` — Edits out the post link of a SmokeDetector report. If in CHQ, this should be used sparingly. 

## Silent mode and aliases

If you don't want SmokeDetector to reply when executing a command add a `-` sign at the end, for example, `fp-`. This is a good practice to cut down on chatroom clutter.  Note that SmokeDetector will always report any errors, even if the `-` is present. The hyphen can be placed after the command itself or after its parameter. The following commands support silent mode: replying to spam reports, managing black- and white-list, and managing chat notifications.

Also, some frequently used commands have one-letter aliases or convenient words that can be used instead:

|   Command | Alias of |
|----------:|----------|
|         f | fp-      |
|   notspam | fp-      |
|         k | tpu-     |
|      spam | tpu-     |
|      rude | tpu-     |
|     abuse | tpu-     |
|   abusive | tpu-     |
| offensive | tpu-     |
| vandalism | tp-      |
|         n | naa-     |

## A note on message deletion
Messages by SmokeDetector can be deleted within 2 minutes after they were posted by using the `del`, `remove`, or `gone` commands. After 2 minutes are up, SmokeDetector cannot delete its own messages in response to those commands, so any deletion after that window must be done by a moderator.

Messages will also be deleted in *Tavern on the Meta* and *SO Close Vote Reviewers*, or *Raiders of the Lost Downboat* if the relevant post is deleted or marked as false positive before the 2-minute window is up.

**Please note** that the usage of deletion commands is discouraged in Charcoal HQ. Generally, messages in CHQ are kept as a record of all reported posts for multiple reasons:

* While we *do* have metasmoke which acts as a mirror of all posts, it does go offline occasionally
* Some userscripts which run in chat (e.g. FIRE) use information from the chat reports to fetch the correct data from the API. 
* It allows for a second opinion on reports, even if one person has marked it as a false positive
* Seeing spam and abusive posts is an occupational hazard in CHQ; we aren't worried if the report contains something NSFW.

The `delete-force` command can be used if a report *really* needs to be deleted in Charcoal HQ.

## Shortcut commands

You can now use a shortcut to post a reply to one, two or three messages
at the same time, in this shape:

    sd cmd1
    sd cmd1 cmd2
    sd cmd1 cmd2 cmd3
    sd cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 cmd4
    sd cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 cmd4 cmd5

cmd1 will be invoked in the most recent message, cmd2 on the message
before that and cmd3 on the message before that, and so on.

It's also possible to skip a message. Replace a command with a `-` to skip a
message. For example, `sd - delete` skips the most recent message and
deletes the message before that one.

Smokey will reply to your shortcut command unless all commands have quiet
mode (like tp-) or just don't reply by default (like delete).

A few examples:

- `sd - delete` keeps the most recent message and deletes the one before that.
- `sd tp fp delete` marks the most recent message as tp, the one before that as fp, and deletes the one before that.

You can also put a digit in front of a command so that the command will apply as many times as the digit. A few examples:

- `sd 2tpu` = `sd tpu tpu`
- `sd 2tpu 3fpu` = `sd tpu tpu fpu fpu fpu`
- `sd 2- fp` = `sd - - fp`
