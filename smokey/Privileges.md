SmokeDetector operates a privilege system. That is, before you are able to use a number of commands (most notably the feedback commands), you must be added to a list of privileged users in SmokeDetector's code. 

## Getting Privileged
In theory, anyone can be added to the privilege list. In practice, this doesn't always work out, so *as a general guideline*, we look for a few things to indicate how qualified you are.

- **Reputation**  
  A higher reputation score indicates a higher level of participation on the sites, which is strongly correlated with moderation ability. We're looking for enough rep to indicate that you've been around a little while: generally, 300 on one site will suffice.

- **Participation**  
  We can also simply look through your various accounts on the network. SmokeDetector scans posts for spam network-wide, so the more sites you have accounts on, the better it is for everyone - more accounts means you can flag spam on more sites. We may also look at how active you've been on various sites (and on their meta sites) to determine how able you are to moderate content effectively. Again, we're not looking for a massive or exceptional record, just enough to show that you know what you're doing.

- **Referral**  
  If your request for privileges is supported by a regular of one of the [chat rooms](Chat-Rooms) that SmokeDetector posts reports to, we'll look more favourably upon it - we tend to trust people who are already part of the system to make sound judgements. Additionally, if you've been around in one of the rooms for a while and have made yourself known, you've got a good chance.

These are all general guidelines, rather than hard limits. We understand that there are cases of users who have little apparent activity who can be excellent at moderation; we're also aware that the converse is true. Take note of what's mentioned here, but also remember that requests are judged on a case-by-case basis.

#### For Moderators
If you're a Stack Exchange network moderator, **you're automatically privileged** in [Charcoal HQ](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq) (and in [SOCVR](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/41570/so-close-vote-reviewers) if you are a Stack Overflow moderator). You don't need to be added to the explicit privilege lists, as your diamond also gives you privileges with SmokeDetector. We assume that moderators are, on the whole, pretty good at moderation.

## Standard of Behaviour
Stack Exchange has a [Be Nice policy](http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice) - if you're not familiar with it, you should go and read it now.

As a SmokeDetector user, we expect everyone to abide by that policy. We also extend that standard a little: we expect that you take a professional and constructive approach to moderation, and that you're capable of getting along with the users and administrators of SmokeDetector. Remember - *getting along* is not the same as *liking*. Additionally, the chatrooms are a professional environment - we're friendly, so laughing and joking within reason are fine, but keep it professional.

Charcoal intends to create an environment where all humans are welcome and will be treated equally regardless of personal or physical attributes or lack thereof. You can be part of this by being mindful of how what you say may be construed by others.

The [unofficial standard](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/29760077#29760077) is this:

> If a system administrator ends up getting pinged more than once because you're abusing the system or seriously bugging other users, your privileges are likely to be revoked.

Exercise some common sense, bring your sense of humour, and we'll all get along just fine.

Breaches of any part of this policy should in the majority of cases be reported to a [Charcoal team member](//charcoal-se.org/people) or by emailing `smokey@artofcode.co.uk`. In cases where a breach also contravenes the Stack Exchange Be Nice policy, it can be reported to any Stack Exchange network moderator.

## External Liaison
Occasionally, spam on SE sites gets handled incorrectly. Historically in these cases, a Charcoal member has often reached out to the people involved in this situation to offer advice on how spam should be handled correctly. However, as Charcoal has continued to expand, it has become more difficult to have experienced team members do this, so this is some guidance on how to approach liaising with other people or communities around the SE network.

**If you're going to go to other sites and advise people on how to deal with spam**, that's awesome, but make sure you're doing it diplomatically. Bear in mind that you will likely have little activity on the target site, and this is the first impression many users will have of you and of Charcoal.

- **Consider necessity.** It's good to give advice, but don't get over-invested. Remember that one mishandled spam post isn't a disaster, and won't bring a site to its knees.
- **Provide context.** Make sure you tell your audience who *you* are (and if pertinent, who Charcoal are and what we do), what happened with the spam post, why that wasn't the right outcome, and what could be done instead. Wherever you can, provide links to back up your statements so that it's not just "some random person from <strike>outer space</strike> somewhere else on the network".
- **Phrase what you say carefully.** Avoid anything that could seem accusatory - it seems silly, but try to avoid saying *you*. If it seems personal, someone'll take it personally, and won't be able to see the real issue because they think they've been insulted. Instead of *"You did X and you shouldn't have!"*, try *"X happened to Y post, and* I think *this could have been done Z way instead, according to `[SE policy](link to it)`"*. Talk about *actions* or *posts* rather than *users* or *people*.
- **Assume good faith.** Even if a post has been handled incorrectly, it most likely wasn't done out of malice. Remember that, and don't treat people like they're idiots for not knowing the policy.

Remember to [Be Nice](http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice) at all times. If *at any point* you don't feel you can start or continue a conversation diplomatically and Nicely, *step back*. There are plenty of other users who can help out; if necessary, call on one of the mods involved in the project - they're used to being diplomatic with irksome users.
