# Stickers Terms
Charcoal has a small supply of logo stickers. Whether you've bought them or earned them, these terms cover how the process pans out. The person responsible for this process is [ArtOfCode](https://stackexchange.com/users/3457374).

## 1. Data Handling
In order to ship you stickers, I need to collect some personal data from you so that I can manage your order and get stickers to you. That means at least the following:

 - Email address
 - Telephone number
 - Name
 - Full postal address
 
I will also collect a link to your Stack Exchange profile. This means that **you are telling a stranger from the Internet your location**. If that's not something you're comfortable with, now is the time to back out.

This information will be treated according to the provisions of the GDPR. Your data will be collected via a Google Form and stored in the USA. Your data will be stored indefinitely so that if you wish to get hold of more stickers at a later date I don't have to collect it again - you do have the right to request I delete your data sooner than that: see 1.1 Your rights, below.

### 1.1 Your rights
Under the GDPR, you have the following rights in relation to your data:

 - **Right to access** - you may request at any time a copy of the information I have stored about you.
 - **Right to rectification** - you may request that I correct any information I hold about you that is inaccurate, or complete any information that is incomplete.
 - **Right to erasure** - you may request that I delete your personal data.
 - **Right to restrict processing** - you may request that processing of your personal data is limited to specific purposes. Since I only use your data to ship you stickers, you may request I don't do this if you wish, but I will be unable to ship you stickers.
 - **Right to object** - you may object to my processing of your personal data. Again, this may prevent me shipping stickers to you.
 - **Right to portability** - you may request that your information is provided to you in a format that is convenient for your further use for similar purposes.
 
The Data Controller for this process is me - ArtOfCode. I am contactable at art@charcoal-se.org.

### 1.2 Further dispatchers
If there are a number of sticker packs being sent out to the same country at once, I may use a second-level dispatcher based in the target country to help keep costs down. You will be informed of who any such dispatcher is and given the chance to request that your stickers be sent directly to you instead.

### 1.3 Shipping addresses
If you're not comfortable giving me your home address, you may alternatively provide another convenient address for you. That could be your place of work, or an informed, consenting friend, relative, or neighbour.

Be aware, however, that I am unable to cover cases where you choose to do this and are subsequently unable to retrieve your stickers from the address. If this happens, no refund will be given and no free second attempt is available.

## 2. Payment
If you are buying stickers, you'll need to pay before I can ship your stickers to you. Once I've let you know what the current price is, please pay via PayPal: [paypal.me/artofcode](https://paypal.me/artofcode).

**I need to receive the full amount I specified**, _after_ any currency conversion or other PayPal fees. PayPal is reasonable with its fees, but you remain responsible for paying them.

## 3. Refunds
You may request a refund at any time before your stickers are shipped. I will return in full the amount you paid me, and I will cover any currency conversion fees for its return. Your sticker shipment will of course be cancelled and not shipped to you.

Once your stickers have been shipped, you will not be eligible for a refund. I am explicitly not responsible for failures in the postal or customs systems causing your stickers to be lost, damaged, or stolen, and such cases will not entitle you to a refund.

Thanks! Terms and conditions suck, but it's good to have it all in black and white just in case.
