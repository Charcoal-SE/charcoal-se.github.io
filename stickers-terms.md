# Stickers Terms
Charcoal has a small supply of logo stickers. Whether you've bought them or earned them, these terms cover how the process pans out. The person responsible for this process is [ArtOfCode](https://stackexchange.com/users/3457374).

## 1. Data Handling
In order to ship you stickers, I need to collect some personal data from you. That means at least the following:

 - Email address
 - Telephone number
 - Name
 - Full postal address
 
I will also collect a link to your Stack Exchange profile. This means that **you are telling a stranger from the Internet your location**. If that's not something you're comfortable with, now is the time to back out.

I recognise that this information is personally-identifiable, and will treat it with the care due to such information.

### 1.2 Further dispatchers
If there are a number of sticker packs being sent out to the same country at once, I may use a second-level dispatcher based in the target country to help keep costs down. You will be informed of who any such dispatcher is and given the chance to request that your stickers be sent directly to you instead. Dispatchers will be held to the same standards with regards to data handling as I hold myself.

### 1.3 Shipping addresses
If you're not comfortable giving me your home address, you may alternatively provide another convenient address for you. That could be your place of work, or an informed, consenting friend, relative, or neighbour.

Be aware, however, that I am unable to cover cases where you choose to do this and are subsequently unable to retrieve your stickers from the address. If this happens, no refund will be given and no free second attempt is available.

## 2. Payment
If you are buying stickers, you'll need to pay before I can ship your stickers to you. Once I've let you know what the current price is, please pay via PayPal: [paypal.me/artofcode](https://paypal.me/artofcode).

**I need to receive the full amount I specified**, _after_ any currency conversion or other PayPal fees. PayPal is reasonable with its fees, but you remain responsible for paying them.

## 3. Refunds
You may request a refund at any time before your stickers are shipped. I will return in full the amount you paid me, and I will cover any currency conversion fees for its return. Your sticker shipment will of course be cancelled and not shipped to you.

Once your stickers have been shipped, you will not be eligible for a refund. I am explicitly not responsible for failures in the postal or customs systems causing your stickers to be lost, damaged, or stolen, and such cases will not entitle you to a refund.

Thanks! Terms and conditions suck, but it's good to have it all in black and white just in case.
