### Route Name
Posts by URLs

### Route URL

    GET  /api/posts/urls
    POST /api/posts/urls

### Description & Usage
This route provides a way to access posts without having their metasmoke IDs; instead, you can use the URL to the post.

Pass a semicolon-delimited list of URLs to the posts in the `urls` query string parameter. Each URL must follow a specific format to match a post successfully. For questions, the URL should look like this:

    //drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/319845

For answers, the URL should be akin to this:

    //drupal.stackexchange.com/a/748265

In each case, replace the site and post ID with the correct values for your targeted post. The ID in this case is the **Stack Exchange ID**, not the metasmoke ID.

This route supports both GET and POST requests, for the event that your list of URLs is too long for a GET.

### Example
**Request:**

    HTTP/1.1 GET /api/posts/urls?urls=//drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/193526

**Response:**
