# People

These are the people who make it all work. People in **bold** have credentials to run SmokeDetector, including metasmoke integration tokens. People with (RO) after their names are room owners.

If you're wondering who you should talk to about something, [there's a guide for that](/pings/).

<section>
## Administrators {#admins}

These people get pinged a lot. (GH) indicates a GitHub organisation admin, and (MS) indicates an admin on metasmoke.

## Developers {#devs}

These people have at some point contributed code of some variety, whether it be to Smokey, MS or a userscript. If you're wondering why you're not on the list, there's a threshold at play here to stop the list getting too long.
