# People

These are the people who make it all work. People in **bold** have credentials to run SmokeDetector, including metasmoke integration tokens. People with (RO) after their names are room owners.

If you're wondering who you should talk to about something, [there's a guide for that](/pings/).

<section>
## Administrators {#admins}

These people get pinged a lot. They all have administrative access on metasmoke and the [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE).

## Developers {#devs}
