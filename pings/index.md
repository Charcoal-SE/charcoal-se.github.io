## Meta: Who to ping

When an organisation such as Charcoal is maintaining several large projects with many people involved, it can get confusing over who you should ping for help. Welcome to the one-stop shop for all your answers when it comes to getting in contact with the right people.

### I have a question about how to use SmokeDetector/metasmoke/FDSC {#question}

Just ask in [Charcoal HQ](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq)! There are always lots of regulars there willing to answer your questions. We also have a [wiki](https://charcoal-se.org/smokey) for SmokeDetector, and [instructions](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/Userscripts/wiki/FDSC) for FDSC which will answer many of your questions for you.

### I have a feature request for SmokeDetector/metasmoke/FDSC {#feature-request}

First, put your idea out the folks in Charcoal HQ. If there seems to be a general consensus that it is a good idea, make an issue on the appropriate GitHub repository so that it is easier to track and makes it harder to forget about it.

First of all, check that Smokey isn't responding to any commands.

If all else fails, please ping one of the people with a **bold name** on [this list](/people), they will be able to start a backup instance of SmokeDetector.
