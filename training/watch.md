# 3. When do you watch spam?
Adding websites and keywords to be watched by SmokeDetector is a big part of being a privileged
user on Charcoal. Unless a post is ***obvious*** spam, it can sometimes be a bit overwhelming to
keep up with new software terms, libraries and projects (nuget, chocolatey, mustache, etc.) and
know what is legit and what is not. We recommend doing a bit of research before you add a watch.

 - **Search** for the URL or keyword on [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/)
   - Use `url:example.com` in the search bar to find all questions and answers that has that website
     in them. Check how many hits comes up and if it's only the spam and 2-3 other posts it will
     typically be OK do add it.
   - Keywords can be searched just like normal text, but multiple keywords should be enclosed in
     quotation marks. Example: `"key word"` and `"more words to search for"`. In this way it will
     only show results for the actual text you search for. Stack Exchange will otherwise show results
     for each searched word and this will typically return too many hits.
 - **Check** [open pull requests](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector/pulls) on SmokeDetector
   Github. The watch you want to add might already be queued for approval. It's always a good idea to
   check and make sure it's not a duplicate.
