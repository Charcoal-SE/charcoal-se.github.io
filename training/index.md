# Introduction to Participating
Hi! So you're interested in being "part" of Charcoal. That's awesome! While we don't like
being too nitpicky about who our members are, it's important that everyone is on the same
page when it comes to what we do and how we do it.

So, consider this short series of documents your official unofficial training. Have a read
through them, and talk to someone in [Charcoal HQ][hq] if there's anything you don't
understand or if you still have questions. Don't worry if you're still not 100% sure of
everything - you'll pick it up as you go.

## Participation
Just so we're clear on this - there are no minimum participation requirements for
Charcoal. I know being linked to an intimidating series of documents kinda brings that
feeling with it, but rest easy. You're equally awesome if
you handle 1 spam post a month or if you handle 1000. This introduction series is just making
sure we're all doing it consistently.

## Introduction Index
This is a list of all the documents in this series. Start at the top and work your way down.
