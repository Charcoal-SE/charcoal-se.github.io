# 2. What's spam?
Stack Exchange uses a specific definition of spam that's different to the definition used
by many other sites. It's most concisely detailed in the flag dialog:

> Exists only to promote a product or service, does not disclose the author's affiliation.

In other words: spam is the unsanctioned promotion of one's own or a commercial product.

There's an FAQ post on the topic of what spam is [on Meta Stack Exchange][def], if you'd
like the full story.

That means this is spam:

> Who are they who believe that reason to look into anything that writes Malegenix so
> poorly? Do you have to not appear adventurous? It is also rewarding when you discover
> a Malegenix. This can be sized to fit. They were a lot more active after this. I can
> express this touching on Malegenix. That is dirty. It seems very interesting. Isn't this
> exactly the function of Malegenix today?  
> Visit here \<spammy link\>

(That's a [real post][post], by the way.) This is also spam, if the blog belongs to the
post's author:

> Visit this awesome blog (link) to find the answer!

However, this is not:

> To fix your problem, you should foo your bar and pass your baz to quux.  
> I wrote about this in more detail on my blog (link).

That post discloses the fact that the blog is the author's, so it's okay. This isn't spam
either:

> delete me delete me delete me delete me delete me

If you come across something along those lines, it's most likely self-vandalism - where a
post's author has removed a post's content in an effort to delete it. That's not something
Stack Exchange allows, but it's not spam.

As always, use your best judgement, and ask if you're not sure.
