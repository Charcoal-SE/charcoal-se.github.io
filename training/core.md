# 8. Further Privileges: Core
When you've been working within Charcoal for a while, there are further levels of privileges
that you may be interested in getting. For most people, the first of these is Core.

## What does Core give you?
The Core role is intended to mark out who our core contributors are. Primarily, it gives you
access to a bunch of new tools within metasmoke. Secondarily, your account is also
prioritised for autoflagging - a proportion of the autoflags on each post are reserved for
core users.

## How do you get it?
The Core role is granted, and potentially removed, manually by metasmoke admins. There's no
specific criteria which must be met. It's granted when the admins feel that it's
appropriate, based on the person's contributions to the project. While admins can remove
the Core role, it's rarely done, even if the person takes a hiatus from the project.
