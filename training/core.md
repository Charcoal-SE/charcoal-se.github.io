# 6. Further Privileges: Core
When you've been working within Charcoal for a while, there are further levels of privileges
that you may be interested in getting. The first of these for most people is Core.

## What does core give you?
The core role is intended to mark out who our core contributors are. Primarily, it gives you
access to a bunch of new tools within metasmoke. Secondarily, your account is also
prioritised for autoflagging - a proportion of the autoflags on each post are reserved for
core users.

## How do you get it?
The grant process for core is mostly automatic. If you've given 60 or more feedbacks to
SmokeDetector within the past 30 days, metasmoke will give you the core role when it next
runs the scheduled task (which is at 2 AM UTC every day).
