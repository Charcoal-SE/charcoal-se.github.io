# 1. What's Charcoal?
Charcoal is a user-run, volunteer organisation that aims to help keep Stack Exchange sites
free of spam.

To do that, we have a [team of people][people], and a bot named [SmokeDetector][sd].
SmokeDetector detects spam and reports it to our chatroom, [Charcoal HQ][hq]; the people
present in that room review the reports and take whatever actions are necessary on them.

We keep track of the spam we've caught in our web dashboard, [metasmoke][ms], to enable us
to analyse our results and improve our detection techniques. We don't aim for zero false
positives (i.e. legitimate posts caught), but for zero false negatives (i.e. spam posts
missed).

## Who's Who?
We try to keep hierarchy to a minimum, but of course there has to be a minimal amount. We
have five admins, who keep an eye on the chatroom and the system and make sure everything
keeps running smoothly. Those five are:

 - [Undo]
 - [ArtOfCode]
 - [angussidney]
 - [Andy]
 - [tripleee]

There are more people involved than that, of course - there's a
[more extensive list][people] on the website.
